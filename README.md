- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Arturo-K
I decided to get serious with programming during quarantine, started off with Python.
I had a C++ background prior to this but I would like to venture into Data Science.
Ever since I started, I have been excited about programming. My GitHub is a step to develop fun and
meaningful projects as well as contribute to what others are doing.
